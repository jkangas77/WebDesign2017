    &emsp;Josiah Kangas is often heard of in ancient legend, though in reality he is
    just as legendary as he seems. Though many people try to be Josiah, only Josiah succeeds.
  </p>
  <p>
    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; But what is it like to be Josiah? What is really the essence of Josiah?
  </p>
  <p>
    On days when Josiah isn't saving the world or commencing with similarly heroic acts,
    he likes to donate to orphanages and work at homeless shelters. But when he's not doing that
    either he tends to be found playing videogames, working on inane technological projects, or attempting
    to keep up his semblance of a social life. This is why Josiah tends to only speak of the legendary aspects.
    The rest seems rather dull in comparison. But it's still pretty cool.
