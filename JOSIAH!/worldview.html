    <p> God created the Universe. Flat out, if you want to believe that out there
      floating in nothing there was just a little bit of something that made everything
      else by <i>pure chance</i>, the you go do that. It just seems a whole lot more
      plausible that if you're already saying there was something outside of the nothing, we
      might as well call it God and realize the statistics point strongly to intelligent
      design.</p>
    <p> To be human is to be a member of the species known as Homo sapiens, and therefore
      you should be treated in a certain manner, as the afforementioned God chose this species
      to be the responsible ones. Yay!</p>
    <p> When we die we hopefullly get to be with God. Seems like a rather sad existence if
      death is just the end. Or eternal punishment. Oof.<p>
    <p>(sorry if this was rather abrupt, its just I'm not too awake at the moment)</p>
